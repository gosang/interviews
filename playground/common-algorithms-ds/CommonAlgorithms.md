# Some Common Data Structure and Algorithm Problems

These 15 problems are staples because they:

- **Test core data structures**: arrays (Two Sum, Maximum Subarray), linked lists (Reverse Linked List), trees (Level Order Traversal), graphs (Course Schedule, Word Ladder), heaps (Top K, Kth Largest).

- **Cover key algorithms**: sorting (Merge Intervals), searching (Rotated Array), dynamic programming (LCS, Minimum Path), BFS/DFS (Level Order, Course Schedule, Word Ladder), hash tables (Two Sum, Top K), and greedy (Maximum Subarray).

- **Reflect real-world scenarios**: scheduling (Merge Intervals), parsing (Valid Parentheses), optimization (LCS, Minimum Path), and data analysis (Top K, Kth Largest).
