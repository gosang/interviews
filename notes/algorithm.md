| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sorting Algorithms       | Organize data efficiently. Examples: Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort.                 |
| Searching Algorithms     | Find elements in data structures. Examples: Binary Search, DFS, BFS.                    |
| Recursion & Backtracking | Solve problems by exploring all possibilities. Used in puzzles, constraint problems.    |
| Divide and Conquer       | Break problems into subproblems. Examples: Merge Sort, Binary Search.                   |
| Greedy Algorithms        | Make locally optimal choices. Used in scheduling, Huffman coding, etc.                  |
| Dynamic Programming      | Optimize overlapping subproblems. Examples: Knapsack, LCS, Matrix Chain Multiplication. |
| Graph Algorithms         | Model relationships. Examples: Dijkstra‚Äôs, A\*, Kruskal‚Äôs, Topological Sort.            |
| Sliding Window           | Efficiently process contiguous data. Used in string and array problems.                 |
| Two Pointers             | Optimize space/time in array traversal. Common in sorting and searching problems.       |
| Union-Find / DSU         | Track disjoint sets. Used in Kruskal‚Äôs algorithm, cycle detection.                      |
