Provide the details, steps and c# code for implementing JWT Assertion (client credentials flow) with custom claims using 
Ping Identity (ForgeRock). Provide a client API i.e. c# .net core 8 API which will acquire a jwt token and attach the acquired token as a bearer token to call a protected API. 
The protected API i.e. c# .net core 8 API uses Microsoft JWT bearer authentication configured with well-known issuer URL.

The response's access_token is opaque and is not signed JWT. Provide the details and steps to configure or setup 
the response's access_token as signed JWT.

In ForgeRock (AM), there is no Access Token Configuration in the OAuth2 Provider that the access toekn format can be changed to JWT.


OAuth2 Access Token Modification Dynamic Script for the request assertion payload.

Setup and configure the Script at the client app level, not at the realm OAuth Provider level.
